## Show yourself

歌手：Idina Menzel

Every inch of me is trembling

我的每一寸肌肤都在颤抖

But not from the cold

但并非由于寒冷

Something is familiar

似曾相识

Like a dream I can reach but not quite hold

如遥远梦境

I can sense you there

Like a friend I've always known

如相识旧友

I'm arriving

我在来路途中

And it feels like I am home

感觉如家般温暖

I have always been a fortress

我一直城墙高筑

Cold secrets deep inside

将严寒秘密锁于心中

You have secrets too

But you don't have to hide

但你无需隐藏

But I'm here for a reason

我来到这里只为一个缘由

Could it be the reason I was born

## Halo

歌手：Beyoncé Giselle Knowles

Remember those walls I built?

Well, baby they're tumbling down

And they didn't even put up a fight

They didn't even make a sound

I found a way to let you in

But, I never really had a doubt

Standing in the light of your halo

I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened

Every rule I had you breakin'

It's the risk that I'm taking

I ain't never gonna shut you out!

Everywhere I'm looking now

I'm surrounded by your embrace

Baby, I can see your halo

You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more

It's written all over your face

Baby, I can feel your halo

Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo...

Halo, ooh ooh...

Hit me like a ray of sun

Burning through my darkest night

You're the only one that I want

Think I'm addicted to your light

I swore I'd never fall again

But this don't even feel like falling

Gravity can't forget to pull me back to the ground again

And it's like I've been awakened

Every rule I had you breakin'

It's the risk that I'm taking

I'm never gonna shut you out!

Everywhere I'm looking now

I'm surrounded by your embrace

Baby, I can see your halo

You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more

It's written all over your face

Baby, I can feel your halo

Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo...

Halo, ooh ooh...

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo...

Halo, ooh ooh...

Halo, ooh ooh...

Halo, ooh ooh, oh...

Everywhere I'm looking now

I'm surrounded by your embrace

Baby, I can see your halo

You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more

It's written all over your face

Baby, I can feel your halo

Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo...

Halo, ooh oh...

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo...

Halo, ooh oh...
